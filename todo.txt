// If you are feeling adventurous, 
// these are some of the things I would like to see.
// Feel free to post me the code and I will add the best to the class and

// > Optional pixel scrolling rather than character scrolling, 
//   maybe with ScrollWindowEx()
// > Some extra character graphic bitmaps
// > An intelligent resizing routine for the characters.
